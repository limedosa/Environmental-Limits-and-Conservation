### (1b) Construct the population projection matrix and calculate the growth rate

```{r}

#Vital Rates
S1 <- 0.706 #1st year survival
S2 <- 0.650 #Juvenile survival
S3 <- 0.750 #Sub-adult survival
S4 <- 0.823 #Adult survival
M2 <- 0.398 #Fraction of juvenile survivors that become sub-adults
M3 <- 0.108 #Fraction of sub-adult survivors that become adults
E <- 2.5    #Per capita adult fecundity (number of eggs)

#Creates an "empty" 4x4 matrix of zeros
A <- array(0, c(4,4))

# # # Define matrix elements from vital rates below # # #

#Here is an example for the Egg to Juvenile Transition
A[2,1] <- S1  

#Continue building the matrix



#Calculate the population growth rate



```


### (1d) Add in the effect of poaching


```{r}

#Be sure to set the poaching level to 0.05 (or 5%)



#Copy in the code from above and alter it to incorporate the effect of poaching




#Calculate the population growth rate



```


### (1e) What is the sensitivity of Lambda to poaching?

Note that you do not need to answer this question in R, but you can if you want to


```{r}

#Calculate the sensitivity value associated with poaching



```
